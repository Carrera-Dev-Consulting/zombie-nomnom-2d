# Zombie Nom Nom 2D

This is a 2d click game to play the zombie nom nom game I had created that was inspired by the rules of Zombie Dice. This is an open source free implementation and is free to use share and distribute. The game is written in the Godot engine and will be maintained by us with any new feature requests welcome so we can add more to this game!!


## Setup

To be able to compile the game we will update these instructions if things change but since it is a small game we will try to make it easy to just pull the repo open the project in `Godot` and then you should be able to either immediately export and or click the play button and should run the game from the starting scene.

## Testing

To make sure you can run the testing in the project ensure you have `GUT` installed from the `Asset Library` in `Godot`. If you contribute please make sure any code that contains logic is tested within a `GUT` test or it will be rejected.

# Contributing

If you wish to know more about contributions to the game please look at our [Contribution Guide](./contributing.md). We have defined the rules and styles in there as well as how we expect PR's to be formatted.
