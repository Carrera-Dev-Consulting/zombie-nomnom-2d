## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you would like to report a vulnerability please open an Issue using the vulnerability template!!
Given that we maintain this repo part time it might be up to a week before we can give our first response.
If you can we would appreciate you fixing the vulnerability and opening a PR that we can validate. 
Other then that it might take another week before we can actually work on it ourselves.
